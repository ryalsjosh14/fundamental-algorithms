# Fundamental algorithms from scratch

This repository is a compilation of fundamental alorithms and data structures implemented from scratch in Python. 

## Motivation

My goal in this project was to enhance my own understanding of these algorithms and data structures by personally implementing them. 
Additionally, I hope this can serve as a guide to anyone who is struggling to implement one of these algorithms, or is seeking a
method of learning. I created this repository as I followed the YouTube lecture series of Tim Roughgarden's algorithm class at Stanford.
